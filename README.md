Gists by ~kqr
=============

My GitHub Gist started to get messy with over 30 gists without any sort of
organisation, so this is an attempt to make things a little easier to browse.

After something has been on my gist pages for a long enough time, it makes it
into this repo. I hope that will be sufficient.
